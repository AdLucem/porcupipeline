## Reasons For Using The Haskell Base

- It's the only mature, in-active-dev software that does at least part of what I want.

- I know the people working on it, and they're very responsive on chat. So if we discover a snag in the software/thing we don't understand, I can just ping them and get a quick answer. Also, I *am* people working on it.

- Type system and type safety.
